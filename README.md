# ExositeAndroidSample
This is an Android sample to implement a lightweight HTTP-based API for writing to and reading from the Exosite One Platform. I create a GPS data source from the Exosite Platform and write the current gps coordinates from the Android phone to the 'gps' data source.

If you want to know Exosite API, you can read the [Exosite doc](https://github.com/exosite/docs).
